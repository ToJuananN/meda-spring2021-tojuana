    <h1>The Art Of Reading</h1>

<h2>Welcome to the Art of Reading with ToJuana</h2>
<p>
    My name is ToJuana and I'm aspiring Software Engineer. 
    I live in San Francisco, CA but I'm originally from Monterey, CA.  
    My hobby is reading. I enjoy reading for so many reasons. Reading allows me 
    to travel anywhere in the world and enjoy different cultures. I learn how people live and thrive in 
    different parts of the world. Reading increases my knowledge, vocabulary and my perspective on different topics that I am interested in. Reading also develops my brain and gives me the ability to experience life in much broader fashion. 
    I believe knowledge is everything and once you have it, no one can ever take that away from you.

<h3>Enjoying the Art of Reading</h3>
<p>
    In order to get the most out of reading you must have a broad 
    range of reading material. First, explore all of the free options. 
    Once you obtain a library card you can utilize the free options in your local public library. 
    Reading can get expensive. Second, you should have a collection of  
    books in all forms, audio, softback, hardback, and online. 
    Itâ€™s good to have reading material for whatever situation you may be in. 
    Third, you should join a book club. You can read alone but it can be enjoyable to have a community 
    of people that you can experience certain books with.
