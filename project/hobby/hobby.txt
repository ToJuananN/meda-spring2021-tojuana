My name is ToJuana and I'm aspiring Software Engineer. 

I live in San Francisco, CA but I'm originally from Monterey, CA.  

My hobby is reading. I enjoy reading for so many reasons. Reading allows me 

to travel anywhere in the world and enjoy different cultures. I learn how people live and thrive in 

different parts of the world. Reading increases my knowledge, vocabulary and my perspective on different topics that I am interested in. 
Reading also develops my brain and gives me the ability to experience life in much broader fashion. 
I believe knowledge is everything and once you have it, no one can ever take that away from you. 


In order to get the most out of reading you must have a broad 

range of reading material. First, explore all of the free options. 

Once you obtain a library card you can utilize the free options in your local public library. 
Reading can get expensive. Second, you should have a collection of  

books in all forms, audio, softback, hardback, and online. Itâ€™s good to have reading material for whatever situation you may be in. 

Third, you should join a book club. You can read alone but it can be enjoyable to have a community 

of people that you can experience certain books with.
