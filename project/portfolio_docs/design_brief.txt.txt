My name is ToJuana Newsome and I am an Aspiring Software
Engineer. Iam switching from my long-time profession as an 
Executive Assitant to the Tech Industry. Although I enjoyed
the Administrative field I find that the Tech Industry is more
challenging.

I enjoy the challenge that coding provides me. I look
forward to building app. that will allow me to help
people in todays fast paced world.

When I'm not self teaching myself to code and networking
with other students and professional in the Tech Industry
I enojoy reading. Coding is very challenging and demanding
so, I love to read to rest my brain. For more information on 
my love for reading check out The Art of Reading with ToJuana
