       <h1>The Art of Reading</h1>
       <p>
        My hobby is reading. I enjoy reading for so many reasons. Reading allows me 
        to travel anywhere in the world and enjoy different cultures. I learn how people live and thrive in 
        different parts of the world. Reading increases my knowledge, vocabulary and my perspective on different topics that I am interested in. Reading also develops my brain and gives me the ability to experience life in much broader fashion. 
        I believe knowledge is everything and once you have it, no one can ever take that away from you.
